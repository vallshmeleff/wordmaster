Application for memorizing foreign words
The application shows a set of letters (in the bottom line) from which a foreign word must be formed in the top line.This is a small logical task - in European languages, words have a natural sound. There are no useless versions.
When solving a logical problem - composing a word, you will remember it well. The learning process itself will be more interesting.
